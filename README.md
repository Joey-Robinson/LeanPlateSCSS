# Lean Plate SCSS

[Lean Plate](https://github.com/elamahpla/LeanPlateSCSS) is an incredibly lean boilerplate for [React](https://reactjs.org/) which makes use of [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/) as its preprocessor. I wanted to make a boilerplate that doesn't have a huge footprint, but that can also use [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/) so the solution was simple; Make my own.

# Tools:

This boilerplate comes ready with the following tools:
* [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/guides/philosophy)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/)

These are the most basic tools needed to get you started. You can add other libraries and tools as you see fit, but this was designed to be incredibly simple to get up and running.
